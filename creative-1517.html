              <p><span style="color:#000000;">I think it is red, rich and bold. It’s sweet to hear people saying my name with their
                  accents, hear their voices stretch out its syllables. I love the way my grandmother says ‘<em>Katharine’</em>. My
                  name does not mean hope or happiness, but I have filled it with good traits that belong to me. I think
                  ‘<em>Katharines’</em> have been given their name by pure luck. A mere trawling through the abyss of the English
                  language and finding something which seems familiar. Sundays are the sweetest day of the week. There is always soft
                  background music, the smell of fresh laundry. I always think of my name with the fondness I think of the weekend, of
                  Sundays.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><span style="color:#000000;">The boys you fell in love with were like actors. They were never as exciting as the
                  roles they played. Mia knew this, but she went for them anyway. Because in some twisted way, to hurt created
                  excellence in her body and mind. Her words became polished and beautiful. Her skin smoother, plumper. She became
                  youthful, her eyes wider, lashes slicker, hair healthier, nails stronger. The thought itself carried a weight over
                  her.</span></p>

                  Dark suburbia is scary. It's different from Hollywood films and pastel skies - more dangerous too. The glamorous
                  suburbs filled with stylish women who cry themselves to sleep at night -&nbsp;</span><i style="color:#000000;">that
                  is what we want</i><span style="color:#000000;">. We want Xanax and coke to ease the pain - it's scary to think that
                  the woman working three jobs can just end herself. The drugs and the lights dull almost compared to red lipstick of
                  the new wife. Oh, how should she pay for such a divorce, what glamour! What beauty - a tarnished nickel in the
                  water. A failed daughter’s cry-baby drug boy sicko killing his baby girl.</span></p>

                  An eye for an eye, I’m scared of consequences. So, I watch my shadow and step, avoid the pavement and keep an eye
                  down, my iris circling out. Crying through the veil of tears and watching for a bullet to come through my head. I
                  hear noises at night - a motorbike, howl hoot and bark from the animals - why should they yell at night? What is in
                  our suburbs that make us cry? Pageant queen smiles at me - why the placid look? I don't like her, she doesn’t like
                  me, what else is there to say with that look?</span></p>
