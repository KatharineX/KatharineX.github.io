                    <p>I have a sour taste in my mouth as Aaron’s picture flits across my screen. So, he really was becoming a musician. Well,
                    good for him. I change my tune, lofty. He finally got what he wanted and he’s going forth with his new muse and her
                    crayon coloured hair, and they’ll gather ye round the campfire and make love under the stars and mock Neo-Liberalism,
                    pledge sacrifice to Marx, Joyce, Plath and circle-jerk each other’s ego into tantric oblivion. Great!</p>
                    
                    <p>My new Alexander Wang sweatpants cling thoughtfully to my thighs as I run. Sunlight gazes over the neighbourhood,
                    hitting the trees just the way I like. I run purposefully. There is a certain charm about this street – high-arching
                    buildings and a huge foliage canopy coating the sky. It’s still city, despite the several townhouses with stucco
                    exteriors (who were they kidding?), but just enough suburbia exists to feel slow-paced. </p>
                    
                    <p> Second shower of the day just to feel fresh. Put on heels. Pop a Ritalin. There’s a heavy-weight meeting today and I
                    need to look alive. The Bohemian caravan nightmare still looms over me, but I repress that thought. I kiss Tim goodbye
                    as he’s on call with IT setting up his at-home-Apocalypse trading kit because ‘money never sleeps’.
                    Tim is good looking. He works at Goldman Sachs. His father also worked at Goldman Sachs. His passions include the gym,
                    work and himself and he says he doesn’t take steroids. I touch his arm in an awkward show of affection and his muscles
                    flex under my fingers, jumpy, in a mind of their own.</p>

                    <p>B R I A N
                    I must find someone palatable to date them. He has to be 6’2 because it is the golden ratio. 2 in 6 is 3 and that’s
                    God’s perfect number. Also, if I wear heels, we’re almost the exact same height and as a couple that’s insanely
                    attractive.
                    I met Brian at a lame College party. The first thing he asked me was what I thought of Foucault’s essay ‘Discipline and
                    Punish’. I said it was agreeable, pretending I had read it and we continued our conversation from there. He offered to
                    get me a drink and I said, okay thanks. I pretended to sip on the beer. At the end of the night I was completely sober,
                    and Brian was drunk enough where his responses were brutally honest.
                    Isn’t the concept of macroeconomics stupid because every 20 minutes spent learning the damn thing the world’s already
                    taken new form. I’ve become redundant, some fucking computer’s taken my job.
                    His eyes bulge, frenetic energy pumping. Feel my arms. His muscles strain so tightly I can almost trace the blue-green
                    veins with my index finger. I raise my eyebrow as if to ask, steroids? His arms confirm.
                    I don’t think a computer can wholly replace a trader.
                    At a shitty mid-tier firm maybe, but not at Goldman.
                    He thumps his chest, points his hand to the sky as if to say, here I come baby. I roll my eyes. The work at Goldman is
                    not simply through the opportunistic comings of nepotism if that helps you sleep better at night. He looks at me
                    pointedly, as if to say, you wouldn’t understand that sort of world because you’re a left-wing Liberal Arts student with
                    a penchant for dreaming, too scared of the reality of your own skin even. We talk a little more until Brian passes out
                    on the foyer. Over the horizon the morning fog begins to condense. I’m still pumping with adrenaline from his look and I
                    think, this is flight or fight. Here is a man dismissing your character, your existence. Brian snores softly, then
                    loudly.</p>
